## Problem

You walk into an art museum and enjoy the exhibitions currently on display, but then you begin to wonder about previous shows. You wonder what they looked like, what pieces they had, and you wish there was a way to see, not only the museum space in its current state, but also galleries of the past. We have chosen to focus on the problems associated with the limitations of physical space and allowing museum visitors to learn more about where they are. Our proposed solution is an augmented reality mobile application that would allow visitors to view and interact with past exhibitions and their art.

## Goals

For our design research, we conducted a contextual inquiry. Participants were asked to learn more about their current location (WCMA) by conducting research, predominantly using online resources, and constructing a timeline of events they considered significant in the museumâ€™s history. Our participants were two male Williams students and one female high school student.

## Results and Themes

Through our contextual inquiry, we found that when people learn something new or see a name they recognize, it sparks a desire to learn even more. We hope that our design will cultivate and encourage that feeling in our users. We also found that people like to visualize information, especially through pictures. They provide a physical connection between the past and the present.

One of the biggest challenges we faced designing and executing our contextual inquiry was that it is hard to judge what information people want to know, especially when it is not available or difficult to find.
