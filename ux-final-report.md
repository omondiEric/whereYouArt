## Problem and Solution Overview

You walk into an art museum and enjoy the exhibitions currently on display, but then you begin to wonder about previous shows. You wonder what they looked like, what pieces they had, and you wish there was a way to see, not only the museum space in its current state, but also galleries of the past. We have chosen to focus on the problems associated with the limitations of physical space and allowing museum visitors to learn more about where they are. Our proposed solution is an augmented reality mobile application that would allow visitors to view and interact with past exhibitions and their art.

## Initial Paper Prototype

We created a physical, paper prototype of our design. To simulate the AR component, we used an image of a gallery that we slid accordingly as a user held up the 'device' and turned from side to side to look around. 

The app detects the user’s location and asks them to confirm. Once the user confirms, they have the option to either view a random gallery or search for a specific one. 

The first task is to view a past gallery.

The second task is to interact with a past gallery

## Testing Process

For each of our three tests, we asked our user to complete two tasks:
1. Interact with a random art piece
2. View an exhibition in the current gallery from 2010

In all tests we worked to create a space in which the user could feel comfortable doing this and were sure to hold our tests in relatively quiet areas where this was possible. In each our tests, we started by welcoming the participant and asking if it was ok to take notes as he went through the process. We then moved on to providing a brief overview our project and application design. We encouraged users to think aloud and explain both their actions and their reasoning behind them as they interacted with the prototype. We rotated through the role of the ‘computer’ for each test, with the other group members being note takers.
