## View past galleries
*New - easy*

Funoda is a frequent museum visitor who likes to share his experiences with friends and family. On a number of occasions, he has visited the same galleries more than once, taking friends on subsequent visits, so that he can share his experience. However, there are times when the installations he intends to take his friends to have been changed and are no longer on available. Funoda resorts to using pictures he took, but wishes there was a way for his friends to experience the gallery as it was, when he first visited it.

## Interact with past galleries
*New - moderate*

Katie is not a frequent museum visitor, but she enjoys learning about art pieces when she visits museums. Upon entering a gallery, Katie wonders what past exhibits have been shown in this space. She takes out her phone and looks up the past exhibitions of WCMA. She checks out the archives of their website, but she is only able to find a couple of selected works from that exhibit. She wishes there were a way to see the gallery as a whole and learn more about each indiviudal piece. 

## Learn more information on installations 
*Existing - easy*

Kantaro enjoys visiting the museum by himself. Although he does not identify himself as someone who is interested in the background details of an installation, there have been a number of occasions in which pieces of art really caught his attention, and the descriptions on the plaques did not satisfy his curiosity. At such times, Kantaro uses the internet to find more information on these installations. Kantaro understands that all this information can not be displayed on the plaque, but wishes there was a way to make it more accessible without having to search for it by himself.

## Explore WCMA spaces
*Existing - easy*

Jane is a student who likes to visit museums. She finds them to be peaceful places where she can look at art and study. On one of her recent visits, she learned that there are spaces beyond the museum itself, one of which was a table near the museum. Upon this finding, she immediately went to the quad area to check it out. She was immediately inquisitive about the markings on the table and used the internet to read more about it. After that, she sat at the table and read a book. She wish she had known about this space earlier and wish she had easier access to information about the space. She wonders if there are other museum spaces that she hadn’t known about.

## Learn about WCMA’s history 
*Existing - easy*

Katherine is an art history student who is a frequent visitor. Oftentimes, when she visits museums, she is familiar with the history behind art pieces and similar art pieces produced around specific time periods. On one visit, she saw a photograph of the museum dated a century ago and was amazed at how different it looked. This sparked her interest to learn more about the history of the museum building itself. She did some research online and read through the museum’s history webpage. However, she wishes that information were already in the museum for her to access and to spark her interest earlier.

## Encounter past history of WCMA
*New - hard*

Chris doesn’t usually go to museums, but is a curious person. When he visits museums, he usually looks at the art pieces and reads about them in the plaques on the wall. Looking at art pieces usually already fills up his time. Chris is a person who may not realize that he is interested in exploring more about something until he comes across the idea in the first place. He usually finds that one small spark is enough to get him to dig deeper and learn about something even if he wasn’t aware that it was a subject of interest initially.
