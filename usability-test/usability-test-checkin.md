title: Usability Test Check-In
---

##Protocol
Our first usability test was conducted in one of the common rooms in Lehman, with a fourth year Computer Science major student, Kim (a Lehman resident), as our participant. Our aim was to make Kim as comfortable as possible throughout this exercise, which influenced our decision in picking Lehman as the test site. We started by welcoming the  participant and asking if it was ok to take notes as he went through the process. We then moved on to providing a brief overview our project and application design, and encouraged the participant to be vocal throughout the process, making it clear that his feedback would be very useful towards improving our product.
