title: Usability Test Check-In
---

## Protocol
Our first usability test was conducted in one of the common rooms in Lehman, with a fourth year Computer Science major student, Kim (a Lehman resident), as our participant. Our aim was to make Kim as comfortable as possible throughout this exercise, which influenced our decision in picking Lehman as the test site. We started by welcoming the  participant and asking if it was ok to take notes as he went through the process. We then moved on to providing a brief overview our project and application design, and encouraged the participant to be vocal throughout the process, making it clear that his feedback would be very useful towards improving our product.

#### Task 1 - Interact with a random art piece
  - Confirm location
  - Choose a gallery
  - Choose a piece
  - Gather more information about that piece
  - Look closely at piece

#### Task 2 - View an exhibition in the gallery from 2010
  - Confirm location
  - Start a search
  - Enter criteria
  - Select show

## Cognitive Walk-Through
- Action of selecting artwork to display more information about it is not visible (3)

We haven't yet revised this as we are still in discussion of the various ways we can solve this problem such as adding highlighting around every frame (without the user needing to tap them) or adding an animation of a finger tap to show the user the supported action. We also believe that once a user knows this is an existing action they can take, it is relatively natural, so having an introductory tutorial for the app may also be a solution.

- Action of zooming in on image of artwork is not visible (1)

Since this is an action that is widely used in various designs, we do not find it critical that this action is not visible.

## Usability Test

For our first usability test, Julia and Linda took notes and Steve was the computer.

### Critical Incidents


1) Confusion with "______" gallery screen, Severity: 2


2) Indicate that art pieces are clickable, Severity: 3


3) Search button, Severity: 4


4) Search Results Heading, Severity: 3


### Positive Feedback
Overall, We had mostly positive feedback from our user about the prototype. He indicated that he thought the idea was cool. The interaction was very smooth--he completed the tasks relatively naturally and minimal guidance. This suggests to us that Kim was someone who was already familiar with this type of technology and that we should branch out in our selection of users for testing.

## Plan
Some aspects of functionality that may seem obvious to us may not be so obvious to other people. In a bid to make our product more inclusive, it is important that we take note of some of the features of our product that may not stand out to a user who is not tech savvy. For our next usability test, we therefore plan to have a participant who considers him/herself as a person who is not tech savvy. We also plan to shift responsibilities, giving every member of the team a chance to experience different roles.
