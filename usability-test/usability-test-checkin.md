title: Usability Test Check-In
---

## Protocol
Our first usability test was conducted in one of the common rooms in Lehman, with a fourth year Computer Science major student, Kim (a Lehman resident), as our participant. Our aim was to make Kim as comfortable as possible throughout this exercise, which influenced our decision in picking Lehman as the test site. We started by welcoming the  participant and asking if it was ok to take notes as he went through the process. We then moved on to providing a brief overview our project and application design, and encouraged the participant to be vocal throughout the process, making it clear that his feedback would be very useful towards improving our product.

#### Task 1 - Interact with a random art piece
  - Confirm location
  - Choose a gallery
Choose a piece
Gather more information about that piece
Look closely at piece

#### Task 2 - View an exhibition in the gallery from 2010
Confirm location
Start a search
Enter criteria
Select show






#### Plan
Some aspects of functionality that may seem obvious to us may not be so obvious to other people. In a bid to make our product more inclusive, it is important that we take note of some of the features of our product that may not stand out to a user who is not tech savvy. For our next usability test, we therefore plan to have a participant who considers him/herself as a person who is not tech savvy. We also plan to shift responsibilities, giving every member of the team a chance to experience different roles.
