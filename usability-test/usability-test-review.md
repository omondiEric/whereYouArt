## Test Protocol

Users were asked to think aloud and explain to us their actions and the reasoning behind them as they interacted with our paper prototype. In all tests we worked to create a space in which the user could feel comfortable doing this and were sure to hold our tests in relatively quiet areas where this was possible. We asked each user to complete two tasks:
Interact with a random art piece
View an exhibition in the current gallery from 2010
We took turns being the 'computer' for each test, with the other group members being note takers. 

### Usability Test 1
Participant: Kim, Computer Science major. Kim was chosen primarily because of scheduling conveniences, but as someone relatively familiar with AR, was able to understand the concept of our design and from there provide good insight on the design itself.
Location: A common room in Kim's building. A quiet space that would be comfortable for them. 
Computer: Steve

### Usability Test 2
Participant: ___, Div 1/Div 2 major. 
Location: Eco cafe. A central location with tables, good lighting, and minimal distractions
Computer: Linda

### Usability Test 3
Participant: 
Computer: Julia
Location: Upstairs paresky

## Critical Incidents
Not clear that art pieces being viewed can be clicked to view more information


## Paper Prototype
(mostly images?)

## Significant Revisions
Make the “more info” pop up bubble a different color from the rest(it’s the only one that can be clicked on to see more information)
Display a note on the above the pieces to notify users that they can learn more by clicking on the pieces
