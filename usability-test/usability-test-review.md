## Test Protocol

Users were asked to think aloud and explain to us their actions and the reasoning behind them as they interacted with our paper prototype. In all tests we worked to create a space in which the user could feel comfortable doing this and were sure to hold our tests in relatively quiet areas where this was possible. We asked each user to complete two tasks:
Interact with a random art piece
View an exhibition in the current gallery from 2010
We took turns being the 'computer' for each test, with the other group members being note takers.

### Usability Test 1
Participant: Kim, Computer Science major. Kim was chosen primarily because of scheduling conveniences, but as someone relatively familiar with AR, was able to understand the concept of our design and from there provide good insight on the design itself.
Location: A common room in Kim's building. A quiet space that would be comfortable for them.
Computer: Steve

### Usability Test 2
Participant: , Div 1/Div 2 major.
Location: Eco cafe. A central location with tables, good lighting, and minimal distractions
Computer: Linda

### Usability Test 3
Participant:
Computer: Julia
Location: Upstairs Paresky

## Critical Incidents
Not clear that art pieces being viewed can be clicked to view more information

## Significant Revisions
- One of the screens that our test users found most confusing was the one where the user was meant to confirm their location. Originally it said "It seems you are in __ gallery" with "yes" and "no" buttons underneath. The sense of uncertainty communicated in the wording, namely the "it seems" in addition to a yes/no option to a seemingly not yes/no question was very confusing for users. We changed this screen to read "Welcome to __ Gallery" with the option to either "confirm location" or "refresh location"
- We needed a way to let the user know that they are able to tap on the art pieces they see in the AR for more information and further interaction. Our test users, especially those with limited experience using AR or museum technology, didn't even think this was an action available to them. To convey this, and provide more of a welcome when the user enters the AR version of their gallery, we added a new pop-up that introduces the show's name and display dates, and additionally informs the user they can tap on pieces for further exploration.
