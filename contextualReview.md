Through our contextual inquiry, we found that when people learn something new or see a name they recognize, it sparks a desire to learn even more. We hope that our design will cultivate and encourage that feeling in our users. However, one of the biggest challenges we faced designing and executing our contextual inquiry was that it is hard to judge what information people want to know, especially when it is not available or difficult to find.

We also found that people like to visualize information, especially through pictures. They provide a physical connection between the past and the present. We also learned that people are interested in being involved with special programs(WALLS) that may help them discover more about the museum.
