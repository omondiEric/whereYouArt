## Discussion of Changes
Throughout our usability testing, we have made a number of significant changes that make our application much simpler and intuitive to use. One of the most significant changes was the addition of a back button to enable the users with navigational freedom within the application. A common occurrence during the  usability testing process was the that some of the participants would get a bit confused in terms of trying to find out what they can and cannot do. We therefore changed the look and words used in some of the prompts. On the location confirmation screen, we made the visual cue stronger by making the “confirm location” button green. 
We have also incorporated the use of more informative prompts, like the one the user receives before choosing between “search shows” and "random shoes”, slightly informs the user on what to expect with every choice.
Before users start exploring a gallery, a prompt informs them that they can explore more about any installation by clicking on them, since this was a feature that was not easily recognized by all participants. 
Of the three pop up bubbles that appear when the user clicks on an image, we decided to have the “learn more” bubble underlined as an indication that it was the only one that could be clicked to display more information. We decided on this after one of the participants tried to click on the “name” bubble, expecting feedback.
